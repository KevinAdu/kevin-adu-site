I think it’s that time of the year where we’re all looking back at the goals we’ve set at the start of 2018 and wondering were they achieved? Many people, like me, may have not or have just forgotten them all together. Then when January 1st hits again we once again form New Year’s resolutions and begin the chase again. This common cycle tends to not think about the progress that it is needed now in the present and what makes that slowly inch towards what we want to achieve.</p>\n<p>Always concentrating on the process and challenges that arise day by day is what drives constant growth. Thinking of regrets in the past or thinking of what may become in the future may not do anything for us if we do not address what is in front of us now.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Living in the Moment",date:"January 14, 2019",path:"/living-in-the-moment/",tags:["Quotes","Goals"]}}},pathContext:{path:"/living-in-the-moment/"}}}});
