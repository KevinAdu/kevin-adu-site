The short film he has been working on as a producer has been nominated for Short Shorts Film Festival &amp;#x26; Asia 2018 which is know as the official qualifier of short films to the annual Academy Awards. I have also working with him too help produce the English subtitles for this short film so my name will also appear in the credits!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing innovation was used to create this animated short film. Over 3000 instant camera were used to this create abstract yet surreal animation which tells the story of the relationship between mother and child. It has been mentioned on various news articles such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180418-00000040-sph-ent.view-000&quot;&gt;Yahoo News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check it out in Harajuku and Shibuya during these 2 days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday 13th June 13:30 - 15:20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday 15th June 11:20 - 13:10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

N2 is the second hardest level you can take for the JLPT, it can be equated to intermediate or upper intermediate level. A few days ago, I received the results for my third attempt and to my surprise not only did I pass, I managed to obtain a perfect score in listening. I had been slacking a lot in my Japanese studies for a while hence why I failed twice before so I wanted to go back the regime which helped me improve my Japanese quite quickly in the beginning. Since a few people have asked how do I study Japanese, I thought I would list the different resource and techniques I have been using so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anki is where I do the bulk of my studying. Anki is a wonderful application that allows you to memorise things quickly. It’s simply a flashcard application which incorporates &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information&quot;&gt;SRS (Space Repetition System)&lt;/a&gt;. The way I use it is to review anything new that I have come across in my studies. Whether it’s a grammar point I learnt from a textbook or an unknown word I picked up from a Japanese drama,  it all gets added to Anki so I can memorise it sometime in the future. I usually use Anki when I’m on the train to and from work as my commute gives me ample time to go through as many flashcards as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dramas/Anime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching anime or dramas helps with your listening and helps you to understand Japanese culture much better. I think when learning a language understanding the culture is key to having natural conversation to a culture you aren’t yet accustomed to. Simply learning the words and trying to translate from English to Japanese in your head and say what you’ve translated will seem very unnatural. From dramas and anime, not only can you learn about culture but you will pick many interesting expressions used throughout daily life. For studying purposes, I watch with Japanese subtitles only. With English subtitles, I tend to be concentrating on just reading the English subtitles rather than focusing on what the characters are saying. With Japanese subtitles, whilst you read it, you can confirm what you have read while listening to the dialogue. Also if you couldn’t catch what someone said, you can rewind and check with the Japanese subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Manga/Novels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading will help you strengthen your vocabulary and grammar knowledge. I think it’s important to read both manga and novels. In Japanese, there is a massive difference between written and spoken language. The difference between manga and novels distinctly highlight it and it is very useful to know this especially if you’re going for the JLPT qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;JLPT Textbooks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I have been studying Japanese, I have been taking the JLPT to give myself an aim so I can continue improving. I have bought textbooks to help study for the exams. Not only are these useful for passing exams, I personally feel they help fill the blanks with discovering common words you may have not come across yet in your studies. The grammar points that you need to know for the JLPT are split between written and spoken Japanese. I personally use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/nihongo-so-matome/&quot;&gt;Nihongo So Matome series&lt;/a&gt; as my JLPT textbook of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar&quot;&gt;Tae Kim’s Grammar guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning I was trying to decide, how should I learn grammar. I think grammar is the most important aspect of a language. In order for you to sound coherent while you are speaking or writing, you need to have a good grasp on the grammar of the language. There’s a lot of debate over which Japanese grammar book you should use when you start learning Japanese. I personally use Tae Kim’s Grammar Guide which is great free resource. A lot of people don’t like it because of its lack of practical questions to reinforce what you have learnt and that it also starts with non-polite Japanese. I mainly like it because it gets straight to the point. I add the example sentences  into Anki and if I need further examples I find it from another source such as a novel or manga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my day to day life, whilst reading or even talking I always seem to come across a grammar point I didn’t know. A Dictionary of Japanese Grammar contains three dictionaries one for a different level of Japanese (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced). They contain a somewhat never-ending list of grammar points with thorough explanations and example sentences to back them up. I tend to use this when I keep coming across a grammar point I just don’t understand or pair this Tae Kim’s Grammar guide to gain a further understanding on a particular point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kanji is the biggest bane for anybody with no experience reading Chinese characters. Kanji are the Chinese characters used in the Japanese language and there are 2000 commonly known kanji. I have tried many methods to learn kanji from continuously writing the character down until I remember to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921&quot;&gt;Heisig’s Remembering the Kanji&lt;/a&gt; method. WaniKani is an application created by the people who own the Japanese blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/&quot;&gt;Tofugu&lt;/a&gt;. Kanji is presented in groups which contain similar patterns making it much easier to learn and more importantly remember. It also provides mnemonics  and present them to you in the best order for learning kanji. Unfortunately it’s not a free application but they do give a trial. I really recommend trying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My go-to online Japanese dictionary which I use everyday. It has a ton of features compared to your standard dictionary. You can search by a drawing of the word, radical or even voice. The dictionary informs you if it is a common word or not, which level it shows up in Wanikani and even the JLPT level. If you don’t know how to pronounce it, there’s audio and even examples sentences using the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speaking to yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As strange and controversial as this sounds, speaking to myself in my room helped me immensely in the beginning. When I started living in Japan, I didn’t know too many people but there is still an abundant amount of native speakers that you can engage in conversation be it in a bar or language exchange etc. For me and many other people I have spoken too, there is an anxiety to speaking in a foreign language when you begin to learn it. Speaking to yourself helps you get over this. You start to get over that anxiety by discovering your mistakes when you’re conversing; finding out which words or grammar points you don’t know that stop you from expressing yourself and just to used to the rhythm of conversation in a foreign language in general. Although this technique has it merits, it may become a habit so please execute with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list may seem a bit overwhelming but as with anything I assure you if you continue to practice everyday, not only will you improve but you will notice your improvements and that will keep the motivation going. If anyone has any other methods of learning a second language, please do let me know. I’m always curious to try a method I haven’t come across.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[4 Years in Japan]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today marks my 4 year anniversary of moving to Japan.

&lt;p&gt;Living in Japan has made me grow tremendously and given me the chance to have so many experiences I otherwise couldn’t have had back in the UK. I believe one of the biggest things I have attained is the ability to speak a second language. When I had first moved here, I could only say a few important sentences which were: “One beer please” and “Where is the toilet?” but now I am able to have conversations with the natives. Even recently I was asked to be an MC at my friend’s wedding which was definitely an honour even despite how many mistakes in Japanese I made!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Japanese has given me another view of people who learn languages and how much effort they put in. I wouldn’t have thought about this in the UK. I was always in the comfortable environment of speaking English so I never appreciated the effort that people have put into learning English as a second language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of Japan that has changed me is how people focus there effort on one particular hobby and become amazing at it. In Japan, I think there’s a strong negative image outside of Japan of people always working overtime and being exhausted. This can be somewhat true but most people I have met had a hobby outside of work and demonstrated a mastery. Be it the salesman who is a hip hop dancer, the designer who is a professional photographer or the bartender who is a manga artist and comedian. I truly respect people that place an insurmountable effort to the point where they can awe people with their talent. I have met so many people here like this and it inspires me to do my best with whatever I’m working on such as Japanese, programming etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have come across many experiences here in Japan. Some good and some bad. Good experiences of being loved by friends and past partners and being able to communicate with them freely about anything I had been struggling with. Bad experiences of losing some of these relationships which had made me distraught. Good experiences of being able to explore Japan with friends which often meant getting extremely drunk but lead to some of the most amazing nights I’ve ever had. Bad experiences of being too poor that not only I’m unable to leave the house and trying to survive on instant yakisoba noodles for weeks. Life is full of these experiences and these experiences have made me what I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question I have been asked a million times now is “Will you stay in Japan for good?”. Honestly I’m still not sure, even though I am still incredibly comfortable my home is in the UK and I do miss it. One thing I do know is that I am attempting to get permanent residency here. Not exactly because I want to stay here forever but because I want the flexibility of choosing where I will live in the future. I do love Japan, it is my second home now where many of my good friends reside so I don’t want to the lose ability of moving back if I do move away. That being said I think I will definitely be here in Japan a while before I consider leaving.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jumping back in]]></title><description><![CDATA[It’s been a while since I’ve written a post.

There’s been a lot of distractions, ups and down (especially downs) recently, so I decided to write a post that would motivate me and let anyone reading know that I aiming to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I’ve went back to the UK in January, I’ve noticed that my Japanese level has dropped considerably. I don’t feel as comfortable speaking or reading Japanese compared to December last year. There are lots of reasons, the main one being I lost the motivation to study and falling into the comfort zone of speaking English. Since it’s such a waste to let my efforts just degrade like this, I decided to jump back in and start studying again and achieve my goal of being fluent in this language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be tough when you have work and generally have other things to do but I remembered an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleseeds.org/big-rocks_covey.htm&quot;&gt;analogy&lt;/a&gt; I once saw when I started learning Japanese. It was referring to time and how we always have some spare time achieve our goals. I remember in my first year of living in Japan, I would spend the time commuting in crowded trains going through example sentences to understand grammar points. The 5 minute walk to the office to get some new Japanese vocabulary out of the way or even the 30 seconds sitting in the toilet to go over a point I learned in the morning. The biggest difference between the Kevin back then and now is that I was desperate to learn Japanese. In order to become like that again, I given myself some goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese isn’t the only thing I want to improve in right now. I’m currently trying to learn web design and photography whilst trying to strengthen my web programming skills. So I’ve decided on three goals to help me improve all these skills. Firstly, I will take the Japanese Language Proficiency N2 exam this year. I took it last year but ended up failing. Secondly, I will release my portfolio site by the end of this year. Lastly, I will release another site which uses what I have learnt about photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve declared my goals to anyone who has read this post I have no choice but to achieve them. Once again, I feel desperate to achieve my goals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spring Time and Capsules]]></title><description><![CDATA[I personally love spring in Japan.

The temperature starts to get warmer, everyone is a lot more lively and the beautiful cherry blossoms begin to appear. Back in the UK, I didn’t really feel excited when spring came, I just knew that I would be getting some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/09/easter-eggs-2016-best-worst-taste-test-chocolate&quot;&gt;chocolate easter eggs&lt;/a&gt; and my brothers would be home from school. In Japan, it feels very different. Mainly because you can see it in the nature with the blooming of the sakura blossoms and other flowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;university students getting wasted just before they start their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring officially starts with the national holiday Shunbun no Hi (春分の日) or better known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12199262/The-first-day-of-spring.-The-Vernal-Equinox-Everything-you-need-to-know.html&quot;&gt;March Equinox day&lt;/a&gt;. Scientifically speaking, this is the time when the Sun leaves the southern hemisphere and crosses the equator. In other words, in the northern hemisphere starts to get warmer whereas the southern hemisphere starts to get colder. Not only does the weather start to change, but so does the school year. In Japan, the school year starts in the beginning of April. Just before then, it tends to get pretty crowded with the influx of students. Especially in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://japan-magazine.jnto.go.jp/en/1202_izakaya.html&quot;&gt;izakayas&lt;/a&gt;, with all the newly graduated university students getting wasted just before they start their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more renowned symbols of Spring in Japan would be sakura (桜) or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/index.php&quot;&gt;cherry blossom&lt;/a&gt;. This flower comes from the class of tree known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flemings.com.au/ornamental_listing.asp?variety=Prunus&quot;&gt;Prunus&lt;/a&gt;. In Japan, when this flower blooms usually light pink flowers appear and it gets very crowded in parks where people are having picnics and drinking under these beautiful trees. These picnics are known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realestate-tokyo.com/news/cherry-blossoms-tokyo/&quot;&gt;Hanami (花見)&lt;/a&gt; and has been dated back to the 8th century where it was something just for the elite. In this day and age there are many picnics under the sakura throughout Japan where many Japanese are drinking heavily from morning until evening. The one I went to started at 11 and finished at around 6, so you can imagine how much sake I must have drank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very similar to sleeping in a coffin with electricity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During spring, for a brief period I had to stay in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5990496/your-guide-to-japanese-capsule-hotels&quot;&gt;capsule hotel&lt;/a&gt; for a week. Long story short, the lease on my apartment ran out and I was still in the process of looking for a new place. What an interesting experience it was. For those who don’t what a capsule hotel is, it’s simply a hotel with really tiny rooms. My room just contained a bed, television and a couple of sockets. Very similar to sleeping in a coffin with electricity. The reason for the tiny rooms is so that people who stay can save on cost and only concerned about having a place to sleep. Since there are a lot less facilities than a normal hotel room, the cost of staying overnight is quite cheap. I stayed in Shounan Capsule Hotel in Fujisawa for 3800 yen (£24) a night. This was the price of the deluxe capsule room so there are cheaper rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the toilet and bathroom, those are all shared and although it was clean but it did have the odour of men throughout the hotel. I think what was really interesting was the people it stayed there. They were all Japanese middle aged or senior men. It seemed like some of them were going to work right after there woke up and I never really saw anyone who was a tourist which made me think most people were either staying there because they were homeless at the time like me. Would I stay in one again? Probably no. I don’t mind cheap accommodation but there is something a bit off about sleeping in a box like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone is enjoying Spring. Next time I want to talk about the process of renting a place in Japan.

I had come back about 9 months ago for about 10 days but because I was doing a lot of sight seeing and felt like a tourist, I really didn’t feel like I was truly back. Now that I am back living and working in London I’ve come across the phenomenon of reverse culture shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly though, what is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/culture-shock&quot;&gt;culture shock&lt;/a&gt;? In the Oxford Dictionary, culture shock can be defined as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling of disorientation experienced by someone when they are suddenly subjected to an unfamiliar culture, way of life, or set of attitudes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think some of us may have experienced this before when you have traveled to a foreign country and encounter or see things that are considered unfamiliar in the country you have spent the majority of your life in. Of course I had experienced culture shock when I moved to Japan. Even though I have grown quite accustomed to their cultures and attitudes, Japan still feels somewhat of a new world to me. Reverse culture shock is the opposite of that. Since I have been living in Japan for a number of years, culture in the UK  has become a bit unfamiliar to the point where I felt anxious at certain times. So here were some of the UK’s norms I had to get used to again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethnic Diversity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that shocked me when I first went to Japan was the lack of cultural diversity. It seems odd to say this but I was surprised to see nothing but Japanese people in Japan. London is considered one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/21/britishidentity1&quot;&gt;most diverse cities in the world&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in 2011 only 44.1% of people in London are White British, 37% of the population were born outside the UK and over 300 languages are spoken in London. In Japan in 2011, 98.5% of the population is Japanese making it a very homogeneous culture. In Tokyo you do tend to see non-Japanese people but they seem to be mainly tourists but It is somewhat rare meet a lot of non-Japanese people who live and work in Japan. Although, after time I had gotten used to the homogeneous nature of Japan but after returning back to the UK, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of different races I could see. Not even just seeing all the different races but hearing all the different languages. I went into to Uniqlo to buy a jumper but I heard Korean, Mandarin (or Cantonese, I can’t tell!) and even the woman at the register accidentally spoke to me in Italian!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing Roads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another behaviour that I had realised I had lost was the fact that I could not cross roads properly anymore. It does sound strange but in Japan they have the jaywalking law just like America. I do remember when I had started living in Japan I did not know the law about this at all and always wondered why are people waiting at the lights when there are no cars whatsoever. “Just cross!”, I always thought to myself, so in typical British fashion I crossed the roads when there was a green light and got stared at. For any Japanese or American readers, there is no law such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26073797&quot;&gt;Jaywalking&lt;/a&gt; in the UK which means British people can cross wherever they like and not be penalised. From what I understand, Jaywalking was a term that first made an appearance in the 1910s. Jay means an inexperienced person and walk of course means to walk. This term was used by the motorway industry in the 1920s to keep pedestrians off the street. It wasn’t taken seriously at first and then in the 1930s it became the norm. Just like America, Japan take jaywalking seriously. I have been stopped by the police because I have been jaywalking. After coming back to the UK, I honestly had forgotten how people recklessly cross the roads here to the point I was so reluctant to do so and waited for the lights to change. Not just that but even cars and buses gave a lot of leeway to pedestrians who were crossing the roads wherever they please.  Often so those pedestrians usually thanked drivers who had stopped for them with a gesture of waving. This never happens in Japan, but after a few weeks I was back to Jaywalking in London.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Behaviour in Trains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest changes I have noticed after living in Tokyo for two years is the train system. I believe many people have the image of the trains in Tokyo during rush hours being extremely crowded. Yes you’re very correct! I think the worst line to ride on the tube in London (We call the subway the tube in London for your information) is the Central Line or the Northern Line. For the commuting Londoners out there, imagine 20 times that. That is rush hour in Tokyo on pretty much every line. Every morning whilst I was going to work in Tokyo, I’ve been crushed by other commuters so everyone can get to work on time. In the beginning, this was one of the most frustrating things about living in Tokyo. I really hated it to the point I wanted to argue with people who were pushing me. The amount of pushing that happens in Tokyo never happens in London. People who live in London seem to be very wary of their space when travelling on transportation. A lot of people will not even move up even if there is some kind of space just to avoid being in a crowded space. In Tokyo it is the opposite, I wouldn’t say Japanese people like being in crowded space but they are patient enough it to deal with it just to let more people in and also to avoid being late as much as possible. Commuters aren’t the only that push sometimes there is staff dedicated to help stuff bags into the carriages when they are blocking the doors. Maybe some readers have seen the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0A9-oUoMug&quot;&gt;famous videos of commuters getting pushed by staff into trains&lt;/a&gt;. This I have never experienced at all whilst I have been there and I’m not too sure if they still exist. When I started to use the tube here, it was frustrating that I couldn’t get on the train sometimes. I wanted to push my way on which would be the norm in Tokyo but in no way is that acceptable in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you could see some of my predicaments after returning to my life back here in the UK. It’s interesting how you adjust when you are in an environment you are not used to Although once you are used that foreign environment, it’s not so simple to adjust back to what you have been accustomed to your whole life. I hope you enjoyed this post!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What have I been up to since the last blog?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hey everyone! Long time no see!

Long time no see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has definitely been a while since I have written any sort of blog post. First of all I would like to say sorry for not being able to continue with my blog about how my life was going on in Japan. When I had stopped writing blog posts I received quite a few messages asking me, “Where the heck have your posts gone?“. So I decided to bring the blog back and properly inform you of not only what I am doing in Japan, but also an insight into what Japanese culture truly is. Before that though, let me give you an update of what I have been doing for the past year and a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I posted was about my trip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido&quot;&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt; with the Yoshino family. It has been more than a whole year since then, so a lot has happened but I’ll summarise it to the major things. One of the big things was having my visa extended, so I shall quickly explain how the whole visa matter works. Since there is a good relationship between the UK and Japan, up to 1000 UK citizens aged between 18 - 30 years old are entitled to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/visa/working-holiday.html&quot;&gt;Working Holiday Visa&lt;/a&gt;. This visa allows you to travel and work in Japan for one year. After it expires you can then apply for various other visas that allow you to stay longer in the country. My time was running out and I had decided I want to stay longer in Japan. Luckily, I had a company sponsor me and I could stay another year due to my new Working Visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major thing that happened was returning back to the UK for the first time since moving to Tokyo. It had been about 14-15 months since I had eaten a real curry, drank &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribena&quot;&gt;Ribena&lt;/a&gt;, eaten &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nandos.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Nandos&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.morleyschicken.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Morleys&lt;/a&gt; and the most important being eating my Mother’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/jamie-oliver-jollof-rice-recipe/&quot;&gt;jollof rice&lt;/a&gt; (which I received within 30 minutes of entering the house. Best Mom in the world!). It was fantastic to be back, nothing had really changed too much but I realised Tokyo is really different from London. Some things I had missed from London such as going to the pub with your mates on a Friday night then randomly deciding we are going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-pubs/shoreditch-bars&quot;&gt;Shoreditch&lt;/a&gt;. I had also missed things from Tokyo too, such as feeling hungry at 3am and going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matsuyafoods.co.jp/english/menu/&quot;&gt;Matsuya&lt;/a&gt; to buy a delicious beef bowl for 400 yen (Around £2). Returning home after all that time made me realise I missed my family and friends and I really do love the UK but Japan is definitely a second home for me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending about two weeks in the UK, I had realised I have been in Asia for a long time and Japan was the only country I had been to. With that it was decided that Vietnam was due. We decided to go to Vietnam during Silver Week for about 7 days. Oh how short that time was. Vietnam was fantastic! I was a little worried at first because before going I didn’t know much about Vietnam except: what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/24288422&quot;&gt;Pho&lt;/a&gt; is,  the war and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyen&quot;&gt;Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; is a very common Vietnamese name. All in all a very great trip, people are extremely friendly, food is great and there is breathtaking scenery (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/northeast-vietnam/halong-bay&quot;&gt;Halong Bay&lt;/a&gt;, I’m looking at you!). A lot of time was spent in the capital city &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/hanoi&quot;&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt; but also visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Tourism-g298082-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province-Vacations.html&quot;&gt;Hoian&lt;/a&gt; for a bit. My only regret is not staying in Hoian longer. I recommend checking out Hoian in September, it is paradise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the final major thing was that I have met and reunited with so many people during my time in Japan. The amount of interesting and friendly people there can be overwhelming. I can learn so much by just going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unmissabletokyo.com/golden-gai&quot;&gt;Golden Gai&lt;/a&gt; for a night out and talking to so many different people. I think the main factor of this is that of course Japan is not the country I was born neither grew up in so it is always just fascinating for me to conversate with Japanese people. Also a lot of people have visited me whilst I have been living in Japan and I’m so grateful for that. Sometimes it is not so easy being an expat especially when your mother tongue is completely different from that country. Even most of the people who can speak English speak American English so sometimes I was misunderstood!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that gives you a basic idea of what happened to me. Right now I am back in the UK again for a couple of months and then I will head back to Japan. So for the time being I will write about London for the people back in Japan. There’s still the typical strange image of what the Japanese think of the UK, so hopefully I can clarify it for some in my blog. Thank you for reading once again!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
