Which of these dominate is completely dependent on how we view change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So today marks the day where I’m one year from 30 years old… fuck. I’m getting old but with aging comes the accumulation of experiences and with that can become wisdom depending on how you reflect on your past.</p>\n<p>The quote above is from the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1963638.The_Untethered_Soul">The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer</a> which tells us how we can respond to these constant encounters we come across in our everyday life. Of course not every experience we come across will be positive. If you look back at the negative ones pessimistically then they will just be nothing but shackles on your personal growth but always looking back as they are lessons to be learnt from can lead to tremendous growth. Today marks the day that I’ve grown a year older physically, I also hope from my past experiences this year that I’ve grown spiritually and emotionally too.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Ups and Downs",date:"July 25, 2018",path:"/ups-and-downs/",tags:["Quotes","Happiness"]}}},pathContext:{path:"/ups-and-downs/"}}}});
