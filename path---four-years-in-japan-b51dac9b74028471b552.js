It has definitely been an interesting 4 years filled with joy, sadness, surprises\nand whole bunch of other indescribable feelings. I still believe to this day it was one of the best decisions I have made in my life.</p>\n<p>Living in Japan has made me grow tremendously and given me the chance to have so many experiences I otherwise couldn’t have had back in the UK. I believe one of the biggest things I have attained is the ability to speak a second language. When I had first moved here, I could only say a few important sentences which were: “One beer please” and “Where is the toilet?” but now I am able to have conversations with the natives. Even recently I was asked to be an MC at my friend’s wedding which was definitely an honour even despite how many mistakes Japanese I made! Definitely learning the language has given me another view of people who learn languages and how much effort they put in. This is something I wouldn’t have thought about in the UK. I was always in the comfortable environment of speaking English so I never appreciated the effort that people whose second language is English had put in so they could communicate with us.</p>\n<p>One aspect of Japan that has changed me is how people focus there effort on one particular hobby and become amazing at it. In Japan, I think there’s a strong negative image of people always working and never having time which can be somewhat true but most people I have met have always seemed to demonstrate an amazing skill. Be it the salesman who is a hip hop dancer, the designer who is a professional photographer or the bartender who is a manga artist and comedian. I respect people who have a goal that is strong enough that makes them keep going until they have become really skilled in that particular field. It takes a lot of effort and it also inspires me to do my best with whatever I’m working on such as Japanese, programming etc.</p>\n<p>I have come across many experiences here in Japan. Some good and some bad. Good experiences of being loved by friends and past partners and able to communicate with them freely about anything I had been struggling with. Bad experiences of losing some of these relationships which made me distraught. Good experiences of being able to explore Japan with friends which often meant getting extremely drunk but lead to some of the most amazing nights I’ve ever had. Bad experiences of being too poor that not only I’m unable to go out  and chill with friends but eating instant yakisoba noodles for weeks whilst crashing in the same room with a friend since I didn’t even have money for rent. Life is full of these experiences and these experiences have made me what I am today.</p>\n<p>A question I have been asked a million times now is “Will you stay in Japan for good?”. Honestly I’m still not sure, even though I am still incredibly comfortable my home is in the UK and I do miss it. One thing I do know is that I am attempting to get permanent residency here. Not exactly because I want to stay here forever but because I want the flexibility of choosing where I will live in the future. I do love Japan, it is my second home now where many of my good friends reside so I don’t want to the lose ability of moving back if I do move away. That being said I think I will definitely be here in Japan a while before I consider leaving.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"4 Years in Japan",date:"December 30, 2017",tags:["Japan"]}}},pathContext:{path:"/four-years-in-japan/"}}}});
